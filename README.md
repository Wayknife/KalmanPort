##Kalman Filter Port
###Porting of Matlab Based Code for the State Estimation of a Quadrotor into C++/ROS framework. (UKF/EKF).

####State Vector for both Kalman Filter implementations is 14 Dimensional: 
####[position, velocity, orientation, imu accelerometer bias, roll/pitch bias]

####Implementation uses Boost 1.49 and C++11


*Discription/Info Will Go here, ongoing work*
roll/pitch bias maintained at 0 in this exercise.
